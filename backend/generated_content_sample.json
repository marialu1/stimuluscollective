  "description": "We stroll through the cobblestone streets of Old Town Basel, the scent of aged cheese wafting from a nearby fromagerie. Our sommelier guide, with over 15 years of experience, leads us to hidden gems, where Swiss, Alsatian, and German varietals await. On the Rheinweg, we pause at a charming wine bar, its wooden fa\u00e7ade worn smooth by time. Inside, the 2017 Pinot Noir from a family vineyard in Riehen is poured, its crisp notes complemented by an artisanal cheese from a local affinier. As we walk, the sommelier recounts tales of Basel's history, pointing out landmarks like the M\u00fcnster, its red sandstone glowing in the fading light. We continue our journey, tasting and learning, the sounds of the old town - the clang of tram bells, the murmur of the Rhine - accompanying us.",
