# Vision and Philosophy

**Date:** 2024-11-22
**Participants:** Misha (Technical Co-founder) & Claude
**Context:** Defining the core vision for Stimulus Collective

## The Core Insight

> "This isn't a tour company. It's the **Spotify of experiences**."

### What That Means

Just like Spotify didn't win by having more songs—they won by having **better recommendations**—Stimulus Collective won't win by having more tours. We'll win by having **better taste-matching**.

```
MOST TOUR COMPANIES          STIMULUS COLLECTIVE
─────────────────────        ────────────────────
Hire guides manually    -->   AI matches guides to experiences dynamically
Fixed experiences       -->   Experiences evolve based on feedback loops
Manual customer service -->   AI copilot learns each customer's taste graph
Marketing is spray/pray -->   Every interaction trains the recommendation engine
Scale = hire more people -->  Scale = better AI = more personalized = higher NPS
```

## The Steve Jobs Question

**"What would insanely great look like?"**

A tourist messages you on WhatsApp:
> "I'm in Basel for 36 hours, I love wine but hate crowds, I'm curious about architecture, and I want to feel like a local."

And your AI system:
1. **Understands** their taste profile (wine + architecture + intimate + local)
2. **Composes** a custom experience on the fly (not a fixed tour)
3. **Matches** them with the perfect guide from your collective (someone who fits their vibe)
4. **Prices** dynamically based on value delivered
5. **Learns** from their feedback to get better for the next person

**That's not a tour company. That's magic.**

---

## The Unfair Advantage

Most competitors can buy the same booking software, hire guides, create tours.

**Your unfair advantage:**
> "We have an AI that learns taste, composes experiences, and gets smarter with every booking—and nobody else can copy this because it requires both deep tourism knowledge AND deep technical knowledge."

Regiondo can't build this. GetYourGuide can't build this. Random tour operators definitely can't.

But **you can**.

---

## The Founding Team Advantage

```
Alex:   7 languages + Swiss/Spanish dual citizenship
        = Access to ALL tourist segments + local networks

Mark:   Chef talent + gastronomy expertise
        = Authentic food experiences + vendor relationships

Misha:  Technical skills + AI implementation
        = The platform that makes this scalable
```

This combination is **rare**. Most tour companies have operations expertise. Most tech companies lack tourism knowledge. You have both.

---

## The Product Is Not The Tours

The tours, the gastronomy, the art—those are **user stories**, not the product.

**The product is:**
1. **A taste engine** (AI that learns what delights people)
2. **A memory marketplace** (where experiences are the currency)
3. **A collective intelligence system** (where guides/chefs/artists become nodes in a network)

Jobs didn't sell computers. He sold "tools for creative minds."
You're not selling tours. You're selling **"sensorial awakening as a service."**

---

## The Contrarian Move

**Everyone says:** "Start with one channel, one product."

**We say:** Start with **one customer.**

Find ONE person who will pay you €200 to curate their perfect Basel experience. Not a tour. Not a fixed product. A **bespoke experience** designed just for them.

Spend 10 hours on it. Make it perfect. Document everything:
- What questions you asked
- How you decided what to show them
- What they loved vs. didn't
- What made it "theirs"

That ONE experience is your **Rosetta Stone**. It teaches you:
- The questions that matter
- The variables that drive delight
- The AI prompts you need
- The collective skills you're missing

Then you systematize THAT. Not a generic tour. The process of creating **unrepeatable experiences that feel unrepeatable**.

---

## The Creative Twist: Stimulus Scores

Every experience gets scored on 5 dimensions:

```
TASTE    █████████░ 9/10  (gustatory stimulation)
SIGHT    ████████░░ 8/10  (visual beauty)
SOUND    ███████░░░ 7/10  (auditory richness)
THOUGHT  █████████░ 9/10  (cognitive challenge)
CONNECT  ██████████ 10/10 (human connection)
```

Customers see this BEFORE booking. They can filter: "Show me high-THOUGHT, high-TASTE experiences."

Your AI learns: "This customer always picks high-THOUGHT. Recommend the Alchemy Tour, not the Chocolate Tour."

**Nobody else does this.** You're not competing on "best chocolate tour in Basel." You're competing on **"we understand your sensory preferences better than you do."**

## What to CUT (Steve Jobs Approach)

Jobs was famous for saying NO. What we're cutting from traditional approaches:

### ❌ CUT (for now):
- McKinsey-style org structure (7 departments for 2 people)
- OTAs initially (GetYourGuide commoditizes you)
- SEO blog content (waste of time in Year 1)
- Corporate team building (wrong customer for bootstrapping)
- Membership program (premature—need demand first)
- Traditional CRM (Notion + AI is better)

### ✅ KEEP:
- Website (but make it beautiful AND functional)
- WhatsApp as primary interface (intimate, scalable)
- AI workers (this is your moat)
- Collective model (build platform from Day 1)
- Stimulus Scores (your unique lens)

### ➕ ADD:
- Taste graph database (vector embeddings of preferences)
- Experience composition engine (build tours from atomic "moments")
- Dynamic pricing (charge more for better matches)
- Post-experience memory packages (photos + AI-generated story)

## The Levels.io Methodology Applied

### Principle 1: "Make it work, make it right, make it fast"

**Phase 1: Make it work** (Now)
- Simple DSPy signature
- Basic ChainOfThought
- No optimization yet
- Just prove AI can write good copy

**Phase 2: Make it right** (After validation)
- Add training examples
- Optimize with GEPA
- TextGrad for continuous improvement

**Phase 3: Make it fast** (Scale)
- Cache results
- Batch generation
- Edge deployment

### Principle 2: Ship ugly, ship fast

> "Perfect is the enemy of revenue"

Don't build the perfect site. Build the **working site**. Get ONE customer. Then iterate.

### Principle 3: One thing at a time

Don't try to master tours AND gastronomy AND art AND corporate simultaneously.

**Sequence:**
1. Master ONE tour (Wine & Cheese)
2. Get 10 bookings
3. Systematize it
4. Add second experience
5. Repeat

## The First 30 Days (Jobs-Style Focus)

Forget 12-week plans. Here's what MATTERS:

**Week 1:**
- [ ] Build dead-simple Next.js/Astro site (one page: "Bespoke Basel Experiences")
- [ ] Connect WhatsApp Business
- [ ] Set up Stripe
- [ ] Write ONE experience description that makes someone FEEL something

**Week 2:**
- [ ] Find ONE perfect customer (friend, friend-of-friend, DM someone)
- [ ] Charge them €150-200
- [ ] Curate the shit out of their experience
- [ ] Document every detail

**Week 3:**
- [ ] Take everything you learned, build the "taste questionnaire"
- [ ] Start building the AI worker (DSPy module) that asks these questions
- [ ] Get 2 more customers using the questionnaire
- [ ] Iterate

**Week 4:**
- [ ] Launch "Stimulus Scores" on the website
- [ ] Start building the collective platform (basic dashboard)
- [ ] Recruit first guide who isn't you
- [ ] Get them to deliver one experience using your playbook

**By Day 30:** You have validated that people pay for bespoke, you have a system, you have proof the collective model works, and you have the bones of the AI system.

## The Philosophical Frame

"Stimulus" = input that causes a response
"Collective" = many individuals acting as one

You're not building a company. You're building **a living system that stimulates human responses (joy, curiosity, connection) through collective intelligence.**

That's beautiful. That's profound. That's worth building.

## Key Quotes to Remember

> "Are you building a 'better tour company' or are you building 'the future of experience curation'? Because with your skills, you could build either. But only one is insanely great."

> "You're not building a booking system. You're building a copilot for memorable experiences."

> "The AI is trained on your expertise. You're not replacing yourselves—you're scaling yourselves."

> "Every hour they spend doing repetitive shit is one hour you can automate."

**Remember:** The goal isn't to build another tour company. The goal is to build something **insanely great**.
